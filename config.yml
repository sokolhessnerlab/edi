# This is a configuration file for the config package written
# by RStudio. To use, make sure the package `config` is installed,
# via console:
#
# R > install.packages("config")
#
# Then, you can load within a notebook chunk with `library(config)`.
#
# To use default config settings, simply write `config::get()`.
#
# You can learn more at:
