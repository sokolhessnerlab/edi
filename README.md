# Effort, Decision-making, and Interoception (EDI) Project

This is the repository for all code related to the **EDI project**. The repo should contain two tasks and analysis files. This project was designed in spring 2024, and is planned to be carried out in summer 2024 (and fall 2024, if needed). 

## Two tasks

### The risky decision-making (RDM) task (PYTHON).
This task is very similar to that used with the CGE project in the SHLab, and includes...
1. a static risky decision-making task,
2. a grid-search optimization portion which identifies the best-fitting prospect theory parameters for a participant,
3. a dynamic risky decision-making task, in which the choice set is selected based on the identified parameter values from step 1.2, 
4. and eyetracking throughout, recording gaze location and pupillometry.

### The interoception (INT) task (MATLAB).
This task is very similar to that used with the ILD project in the SHLab, and includes...
1. a heartbeat synchronization/detection task in which participants hear sequences of tones played at one of two delays from their heartbeat, and have to do a 2AFC task to decide whether the played tones are in-sync or delayed from their heartbeat (this is roughly 160 trials), 
2. and a heartbeat counting task, during which participants must count their heartbeats during a series of time intervals.

## Analysis files for the project (R). 
R files to analyze the data produced during the task.
